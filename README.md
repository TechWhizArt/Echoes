# *Instructions for the contributors of this repository:-*

- do not delete or change any file related to firebase as they are crucial for website hosting.

- do not delete sitemap.xmp and robots.txt file as they are important for google search engine to identify our website.

- do not delete google html file as it is important for our website verification.

- in short donot delete any of these files, and make another branch to work to prevent acidents, you can use test.html to test code snippets.

- add all the page related files in the public folder, it is important for the firebase to work correctly, test.html file is just a demo so it is located outside.

- the changes you make will not be updated on the official website even if you update the main branch as i am the owner of the website on google so i have to deploy it using firebase first, so tell me after you do the necessary changes.

- you can update the main branch if you are 100% sure of your changes.

- You can also update this readme file about echoes as currently it is just ai generated text.

- Lastly, tell me to update the website on google after you update the **MAIN** branch only.
